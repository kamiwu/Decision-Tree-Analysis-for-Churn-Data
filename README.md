# Decision-Tree-Analysis-for-Churn-Data
It's a homework of the course Introduction to Business Analytics. 
This homework asked us to use the decision tree classification technique on the HW1 dataset and build a decision tree model that predicts whether a consumer will terminate his/her contract.
Code.ipynb is the Python code of the analysis.
HW1_Data.csv is the data I used.
Explanation.docx is my explanation of the process.
